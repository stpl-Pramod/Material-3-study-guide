# Intermediate Level - Angular Material 3 Mastery

> **Level 2 of 5** | **Estimated Duration:** 8-12 weeks | **Difficulty:** üü°üü°üü°

## üéØ **Level Overview**

The intermediate level bridges the gap between basic implementation and advanced enterprise patterns. Here you'll master complex state management, advanced theming patterns, dynamic component architecture, and real-world application scenarios that mirror production environments.

## üß† **Learning Philosophy**

### **From Implementation to Architecture**
- **Beginner Level**: "How do I use this component?"
- **Intermediate Level**: "How do I architect scalable solutions?"
- **Focus Shift**: From individual components to system design

### **Real-World Complexity**
- Multi-user applications with complex state
- Advanced data visualization and interaction
- Performance optimization under load
- Internationalization and accessibility at scale

### **Production-Ready Patterns**
- Enterprise-grade error handling
- Advanced testing strategies
- Security considerations
- Scalable architecture patterns

```typescript
// Advanced NgRx Architecture
interface AppState {
  auth: AuthState;
  tasks: TaskState;
  ui: UIState;
  themes: ThemeState;
  notifications: NotificationState;
}

// Feature-based store organization
const reducers: ActionReducerMap<AppState> = {
  auth: authReducer,
  tasks: taskReducer,
  ui: uiReducer,
  themes: themeReducer,
  notifications: notificationReducer
};
```
